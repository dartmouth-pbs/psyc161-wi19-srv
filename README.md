A simple setup with two books for Runestone Academy server using docker, where all
"source" materials and configurations are provided within this Git repository and
linked submodules.  It relies on having access to the Docker container image which
is currently WiP: https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneServer/pull/1178
so you would need to build your own since it ATM relies on knowing the DB password
while preparing the docker image.
